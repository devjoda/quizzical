# Quizzical - A Simple React Quiz App

**Quizzical** is a simple quiz app that pulls quiz questions from the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/). The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and view their score at the end. This project was built as part of a challenge at the end of [Bob Ziroll's Scrimba React learning module](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-legacy-c003ni72th/~05i). You can check out his profile and other projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bobziroll).
